        - sellIn decreases every day
        - Item.quality
            - is >= 0 && <= 50
            - decreses until sellIn is <= 0
            - when sellIn == 0 quality degrades twice as fast
        - Sulfuras
            sellIn = 0 // doesnt change
            quality is 80 and does not decrease
        - AgedBrie increases in quality
        - BackstagePasses
            increases in quality like AgedBrie
                sellIn <= 0 - quality = 0
                sellIn <= 5 -> increment by 3
                sellIn <= 10 -> increment by 2

    TODO
        - add support Conjured items
