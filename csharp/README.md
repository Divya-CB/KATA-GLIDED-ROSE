# Gilded Rose Refactoring Kata

Introduction:
I will try as much as I can to write my thought processes here as it's one of the requirements. 
I will just write the relevant parts and not my whole thoughts. That would be weird since I was thinking of lunch just before I started. :D

1:
One of the first things I want to do is just get the program to run. so am not fixing anything except what will make the program run.

2:
After this I want to include some Unit tests to ensure all parts are working as they should. This may require some fixing. Not sure.

3:
Then when all tests are good. I can start working with an aim of not breaking any tests.
