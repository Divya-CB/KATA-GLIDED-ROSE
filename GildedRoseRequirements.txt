Gilded Rose Requirements Specification
======================================

Hi, and welcome to team Gilded Rose. As you know, we are a small shop.

Unfortunately, our goods are constantly degrading in quality as they approach their sell by date. We
have a system in place that updates our inventory for us. Our legacy inventory system was developed
by an employee who has moved on to new ventures. Your task is to add the new feature to our system so
that we can begin selling a new category of items. First an introduction to our system:

	- All items have a SellIn value which denotes the number of days we have to sell the item
	- All items have a Quality value which denotes how valuable the item is
	- At the end of each day our system lowers both values for every item

Pretty simple, right? Well this is where it gets interesting:

	- Once the sell by date has passed, Quality degrades twice as fast
	- The Quality of an item is never negative
	- "Aged Cheese" actually increases in Quality the older it gets
	- The Quality of an item is never more than 50
	- "Fine Italian Silk", being a luxury item, never has to be sold or decreases in Quality
	- "Backstage passes", like aged cheese, increases in Quality as its SellIn value approaches;
	Quality increases by 2 when there are 10 days or less and by 3 when there are 5 days or less but
	Quality drops to 0 after the concert

We have recently signed a supplier of Baked items. This requires an update to our system:

	- "Baked" items degrade in Quality twice as fast as normal items

Feel free to make any changes to the UpdateQuality method and add any new code as long as everything
still works correctly. However, do not alter the Item class or Items property as those are critical
data for our business analysts.

You can make the UpdateQuality method and Items property static if you like.

Just for clarification, an item can never have its Quality increase above 50, however "Fine Italian Silk" is a
luxury item and as such its Quality is 80 and it never alters.
